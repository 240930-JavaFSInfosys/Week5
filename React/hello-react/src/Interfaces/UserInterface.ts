/* STOP!! Don't compare React Interfaces to Java Interfaces

In Typescript and React, Interfaces behave more like Java Model Classes - they model data.
We'll be modeling some User data based off the fields in this Interface

Our UserComponent will send data of UserInterface type to the UserInfoComponent*/
export interface UserInterface {

    firstName:string,
    lastName:string,
    userName:string,
    email?:string

}

/* "?" just means the variable is optional. So it doesn't require a value at any point 
I typically make every variable optional unless I know it'll always be required*/
